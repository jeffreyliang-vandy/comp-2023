    "15 pts Imagine that you are in a meeting to devise a statistical analysis plan for an upcoming cohort study of N = 3,000 subjects (to be sampled independently) in which the primary aim is to compare some continuous outcome, Y , between two groups defined by an exposure status. The exposure occurs in about one-third of individuals in the population. Is is suspected a priori that the outcome variance in the exposed group will be substantively larger in the exposed group as compared to the unexposed group (due to, e.g., heterogeneous response to the exposure). Despite this, your collaborator suggests Student’s t-test (i.e., the t-test that assumes equal variances between groups) in order test the hypothesis of a nonzero mean difference, as this has been standard in the literature. As the group’s biostatistician, you perform a simulation to illustrate the possible pitfalls of this approach. The R function to conduct the simulation is shown below (mind the line numbers on the left-hand side, as questions (a)-(e) below refer to them):"
